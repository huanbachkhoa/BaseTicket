# Base Ticket

Base Ticket is a blockchain-based application that allows secure and transparent purchasing and transferring of event tickets. This project leverages the power of blockchain to ensure the authenticity of tickets and simplifies the resale process by using NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to represent each ticket.

## Features
- Secure purchase of event tickets using cryptocurrency.
- Issuance of tickets as NFTs, ensuring authenticity.
- Easy transfer and resale of tickets.
- Transparent and tamper-proof transaction records on the blockchain.

## The problem it solves
Base Ticket addresses the issues of ticket fraud and lack of transparency in the ticketing industry. By using blockchain technology, it ensures that each ticket is authentic and can be easily transferred or resold without the risk of counterfeiting. This makes the ticketing process safer and more reliable for both event organizers and attendees.

## Challenges I ran into
During the development of Base Ticket, I encountered several challenges:
- **Seamless integration between the blockchain network and the frontend application:** Handling asynchronous blockchain transactions and providing real-time feedback to users required careful consideration and the use of Web3.js for effective communication.
- **Designing secure and robust smart contracts:** Ensuring the smart contracts could handle various ticketing scenarios, including refunds and resale, without compromising security was challenging. Extensive testing and debugging were performed, and libraries such as OpenZeppelin were utilized to enhance the security and functionality of the smart contracts.

## Technologies I used
- Solidity
- React.js
- Web3.js
- OpenZeppelin
- Truffle
- Ganache
- MetaMask
